Context:
We are simulating the motion of a ball dropped from a height under gravity, bouncing back when it hits the ground. The dynamics include gravitational acceleration, velocity, position, and energy loss during impact (via the coefficient of restitution). 

Question: 
During the simulation, at a certain point something not realistic happens. Can you pinpoint what happens and when?
